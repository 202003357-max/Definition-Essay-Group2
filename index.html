        <h3>The Misleading Promise of “Stability”: Rethinking the Definition of Stablecoins</h3>

        <p>June 2025, Circle, the company behind the digital asset USDC coin, completed its public offering and applied for a banking license. This development drew widespread attention, signaling that stablecoins are transitioning from niche cryptocurrency products into the core of global finance. At the same time, it reignited debate over the meaning of “stable” in the context of digital money. Many users define stablecoins as assets that maintain a fixed value, typically pegged to the United States dollar. Yet, the term “stable” carries psychological and emotional implications that extend beyond mere price targets. Focusing exclusively on price stability overlooks the complex mechanisms that actually determine a stablecoin’s reliability, such as asset reserves, regulatory oversight, transparency, and the issuer’s authority. This disconnect creates a gap between public perception and reality. The label “stablecoin” fosters a belief in dependability that the underlying technology and governance may not always provide. The challenge is not the technology itself, but how the word “stable” shapes expectations and user behavior, sometimes encouraging neglect of real financial risks. Ultimately, a more precise definition of “stablecoin” is needed to protect users and promote effective regulation in the evolving digital economy.</p>

        <p>A key issue lies in the definition created by the name. When an asset is introduced as “stable,” many people naturally assume that it is safe and trustworthy. The wording shapes the first impression long before a person studies the structure or the risks of the asset. A nationwide survey conducted by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada in early 2024 provides strong evidence for this. According to the survey, twenty three percent of current stablecoin owners reported that they purchased these assets because they believed the risk was much lower than that of other digital currencies. Many respondents also stated that the word “stable” made them think the coin was protected from large changes in price. (Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, 2024) This finding shows that the definition of a stablecoin works through suggestion. The literal meaning refers to a one-to-one price target, but the emotional meaning suggests certainty, security, and immunity from collapse. This confusion matters because the dependent factors that maintain stability are not visible in the word itself. A stablecoin is only as reliable as the issuing company’s reserves, accounting practices, redemption rules, and internal controls. The name hides these essential elements. As a result, people often trust stablecoins for the wrong reasons. This leads to a broader point: stability cannot be defined only by price. A complete definition must include the structures that make the price target possible in the first place. Many experts emphasize that even fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC are only as stable as the reserves and risk controls that support them, rather than the name alone. This view stresses that stable value comes from concrete backing mechanisms and governance frameworks instead of simple branding as a “stablecoin.”(J.P. Morgan, 2025)</p>

        <p>This definition also encourages misplaced confidence, which can produce serious financial harm when markets experience stress. A clear example occurred in 2022 during the collapse of Terra USD. Many investors believed that Terra USD was safe simply because it was called a stablecoin, and the name created the impression that the value could not fall. When the price collapsed, billions of dollars in savings vanished. (BBC News, 2022) Although Terra USD used a design very different from the design used by reserve backed coins such as USDC, the lesson remains important. The public relied on the category rather than the mechanism, and the category created a dangerous assumption of safety. They trusted the name more than the mechanism. This shows that people often make financial decisions based on surface level cues, especially naming, instead of detailed understanding. Such misplaced confidence has real consequences. Users may ignore signals of danger because the name encourages them to believe nothing serious can happen.</p>

        <p>Another problem lies in the authority that stablecoin issuers possess. Most major stablecoins, including USDC and USDT, are created and controlled by private companies. These companies decide how reserves are held, which assets back the coin, how redemption works, and what information is revealed to the public. Tether, for example, has faced repeated criticism for refusing complete audits and for providing inconsistent descriptions of its reserves. These issues reveal a tension between the image of stablecoins and the reality of their governance. (Stefanov, 2025) The public often believes that stablecoins represent neutral digital money, but in practice the stability of the coin depends heavily on the decisions made by the issuing company. This situation creates several risks. The issuer may freeze assets, change redemption rules, provide selective information, or alter reserve composition without warning. Such powers contradict the common understanding of stability. Stability cannot exist without consistent and transparent rules, yet the issuing company has the authority to change important policies at will. This means that the stability of the coin is not a property of the technology but a property of institutional behavior. A more accurate definition must therefore recognize that true stability depends on clear governance, verifiable reserves, and strong oversight. Without these, the public cannot reasonably evaluate risk.</p>

        <p>The current definition of the word “stablecoin” hides more information than it reveals. The name suggests a level of safety that is not guaranteed by technology or by governance practices. As digital currencies become more integrated into global finance, the consequences of misleading definitions become increasingly serious. The name only emphasizes price stability and obscures the deeper structures which determine actual reliabilities such as reserve quality, redemption rules, governance authority, and regulatory oversight. To protect users, stablecoins must be understood not as simple price-pegged assets but as financial products whose stability depends on transparent reserves and consistent institutional behavior. Therefore, we need stronger disclosure requirements, independent audits, and standardized reporting to reduce information asymmetry and prevent misplaced confidence. To align public expectations with reality, it might be necessary to reconsider the term “stablecoin”. Ultimately, we should establish a more precise and accurate definition for user protection and for building trust in the future digital financial system.</p>
